## 1. Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake's own body. The game features a menu that allows the player to start a new game or quit the game.

## 2. Installation
To install and run the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Download the Snake Game files from the provided source.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Snake Game files.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the game by running the following command:
```
python main.py
```

## 3. How to Play
After starting the game, you will see the game screen with a snake and food. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat the food to grow longer. As the snake eats the food, its length increases, making it more challenging to avoid collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body.

## 4. Game Controls
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Try to navigate the snake towards the food to eat it and grow longer. Be careful not to collide with the boundaries or the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.

## 5. Game Over
The game will end if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body. When the game is over, you will see a game over screen with the option to quit the game or play again. Press the "Q" key to quit the game or the "C" key to play again.

## 6. Dependencies
The Snake Game requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- pygame==2.0.1

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` as mentioned in the installation steps.
