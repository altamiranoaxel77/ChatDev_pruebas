```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

This is the main file of the Snake Game. It initializes the game, defines the Snake and Food classes, handles user input, updates the game state, and draws the game objects on the screen. The game loop continues until the snake collides with the boundaries or itself. The game uses the Pygame library for graphics and input handling.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import random
```

This will ensure that the required modules are imported and available for use in the code.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import random
```

This will ensure that the required modules are imported and available for use in the code.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python

import random
```

Also, make sure that the pygame module is installed in the Python environment.

Once you have added the import statements, the code should be able to use the pygame module and its functions correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import random
```

Also, make sure that the pygame module is installed in the Python environment.

Once you have added the import statements, the code should be able to use the pygame module and its functions correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The code seems to be well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the Snake class, the `change_direction` method is missing a check for invalid directions. Currently, if an invalid direction is passed as an argument, the snake's direction will not change. To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that only valid directions are accepted.

Here's the suggested revision for the `change_direction` method:

```python
def change_direction(self, direction):
    if direction in ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"]:
        if (direction == "UP" and self.direction != "DOWN") or \
           (direction == "DOWN" and self.direction != "UP") or \
           (direction == "LEFT" and self.direction != "RIGHT") or \
           (direction == "RIGHT" and self.direction != "LEFT"):
            self.direction = direction
```

With this revision, the snake will only change direction if the passed direction is valid and not opposite to the current direction.

Please make this change and ensure that the code still runs as expected. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code seems to be well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the Snake class, the `change_direction` method is missing a check for invalid directions. Currently, if an invalid direction is passed as an argument, the snake's direction will not change. To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that only valid directions are accepted.

Here's the suggested revision for the `change_direction` method:

```python
def change_direction(self, direction):
    if direction in ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"]:
        if (direction == "UP" and self.direction != "DOWN") or \
           (direction == "DOWN" and self.direction != "UP") or \
           (direction == "LEFT" and self.direction != "RIGHT") or \
           (direction == "RIGHT" and self.direction != "LEFT"):
            self.direction = direction
```

With this revision, the snake will only change direction if the passed direction is valid and not opposite to the current direction.

Please make this change and ensure that the code still runs as expected. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Snake Game project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```
This file specifies that the project requires the pygame package with version 2.0.1. You can add any other dependencies or packages that are necessary for the project in the same format, with each package and its version specified on a separate line. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
