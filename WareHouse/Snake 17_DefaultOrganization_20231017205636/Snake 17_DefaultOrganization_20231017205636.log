We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `random` module is not imported in the code, but it is used in the `update_snake()` function to generate random positions for the apple. To fix this, you need to import the `random` module at the beginning of the code by adding the line `import random`.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function in the code. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code in the future.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `random` module is not imported in the code, but it is used in the `update_snake()` function to generate random positions for the apple. To fix this, you need to import the `random` module at the beginning of the code by adding the line `import random`.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function in the code. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code in the future.

</Comment>"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create the game of the snake that when it eats an apple it gets bigger. It loses when it collides with itself or with the edges of the window. If you lose, return to the start menu to play again..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required classes and modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- `import pygame`
- `import sys`
- `import random`
- `from pygame.locals import *`

To fix this issue, add the missing import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required classes and modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- `import pygame`
- `import sys`
- `import random`
- `from pygame.locals import *`

To fix this issue, add the missing import statements at the beginning of the code.

Additionally, the `start_menu()` function is not being called anywhere in the code. To fix this, add a call to `start_menu()` before the game loop starts.

Finally, the `update_snake()` function is missing a check for collisions with the snake's body. Currently, it only checks for collisions with the window edges. To fix this, add a check to see if the snake's head collides with any part of its body.

Here's the revised code with the necessary changes:

 <Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required classes and modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- `import pygame`
- `import sys`
- `import random`
- `from pygame.locals import *`

To fix this issue, add the missing import statements at the beginning of the code.

Additionally, the `start_menu()` function is not being called anywhere in the code. To fix this, add a call to `start_menu()` before the game loop starts.

Finally, the `update_snake()` function is missing a check for collisions with the snake's body. Currently, it only checks for collisions with the window edges. To fix this, add a check to see if the snake's head collides with any part of its body.

Here's the revised code with the necessary changes:

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required classes and modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- `import pygame`
- `import sys`
- `import random`
- `from pygame.locals import *`

To fix this issue, add the missing import statements at the beginning of the code.

Additionally, the `start_menu()` function is not being called anywhere in the code. To fix this, add a call to `start_menu()` before the game loop starts.

Finally, the `update_snake()` function is missing a check for collisions with the snake's body. Currently, it only checks for collisions with the window edges. To fix this, add a check to see if the snake's head collides with any part of its body.

Here's the revised code with the necessary changes:

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create the game of the snake that when it eats an apple it gets bigger. It loses when it collides with itself or with the edges of the window. If you lose, return to the start menu to play again..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. In this case, the snake game does not have any external dependencies, so the requirements.txt file can be empty.

requirements.txt:

```
```

Save the above content in a file named "requirements.txt" in the same directory as the main.py file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. In this case, the snake game does not have any external dependencies, so the requirements.txt file can be empty.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of having clear and concise communication within the organization. I appreciate your response as a Programmer, but I would like to provide some feedback.

While it is true that the snake game in this case does not have any external dependencies, it is still a good practice to include a requirements.txt file in the project. This helps to ensure consistency and reproducibility, especially when working in a team or when deploying the project to different environments.

Therefore, I would recommend including a requirements.txt file with the following content:

requirements.txt:
```
pygame==2.0.1
```

This specifies that the project requires the pygame library in version 2.0.1 to run properly. Please make sure to save this file in the same directory as the main.py file.

Including the requirements.txt file will make it easier for other developers to set up the project and install the necessary dependencies. It also helps to avoid potential compatibility issues in the future.

Thank you for your understanding and attention to detail. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
