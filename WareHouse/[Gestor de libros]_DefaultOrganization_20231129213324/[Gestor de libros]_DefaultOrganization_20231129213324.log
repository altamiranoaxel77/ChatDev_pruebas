This is the main file `main.py` that contains the GUI implementation using the tkinter library. It defines the `Book` class to represent a book and the `BookManager` class to manage the collection of books. The `BookManagerApp` class handles the GUI elements and user interactions.

The `BookManager` class has methods to add books, save books to a JSON file, load books from the file, and find a book by its name.

The `BookManagerApp` class creates the main window and defines the GUI elements such as labels, entry fields, and buttons. It also handles the button click events to add a book and search for a book.

To run the application, execute the `main.py` file. The books will be stored in a file named `books.json` in the same directory as the script.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter module and the messagebox module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
import tkinter as tk
```

Additionally, the code is missing comments for the classes and methods. It is important to provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method. Add comments above each class and method to describe their functionality.

For example:

```python

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter module and the messagebox module. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python

Additionally, the code is missing comments for the classes and methods. It is important to provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method. Add comments above each class and method to describe their functionality.

For example:

```

Please make these revisions to ensure the code meets the specified regulations."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules, tkinter and messagebox. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
from tkinter import Tk, Label, Entry, Button
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Additionally, the code should include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. Add comments above each method to describe what it does.

Finally, the code should handle the case when the JSON file is not found during the load_books() method. Currently, it only handles the FileNotFoundError exception. It would be better to display a message to the user indicating that no books are found instead of silently failing.

Once these changes are made, the code should comply with the given regulations.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules, tkinter and messagebox. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
from tkinter import Tk, Label, Entry, Button
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Additionally, the code should include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method. Add comments above each method to describe what it does.

Finally, the code should handle the case when the JSON file is not found during the load_books() method. Currently, it only handles the FileNotFoundError exception. It would be better to display a message to the user indicating that no books are found instead of silently failing.

Once these changes are made, the code should comply with the given regulations."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The code has been modified to include the necessary import statements for the required modules, tkinter and messagebox. The comments have been added above each method to describe their purpose and functionality. Additionally, the code now handles the case when the JSON file is not found during the load_books() method by displaying a message to the user indicating that no books are found.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the code needs to import the `tkinter` module and the `messagebox` module. Without these imports, the code will not be able to create the GUI and display message boxes.

To fix this issue, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
import tkinter as tk
```

Once these import statements are added, the code should be able to create the GUI and display message boxes correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the code needs to import the `tkinter` module and the `messagebox` module. Without these imports, the code will not be able to create the GUI and display message boxes.

To fix this issue, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
import tkinter as tk
```

Once these import statements are added, the code should be able to create the GUI and display message boxes correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
