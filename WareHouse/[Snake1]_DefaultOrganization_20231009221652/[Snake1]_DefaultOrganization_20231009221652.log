This is the complete code for the Snake Game in Python using the Pygame library. The game window is created using Pygame, and the Snake and Apple classes handle the movement, collision detection, and drawing of the snake and apple. The game loop continuously updates the game state, checks for collisions, and handles user input. The game ends when the snake hits the window borders or itself. The score is displayed at the end of the game.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module and the sys module. These modules are required for the game to run properly. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import sys
```

Once you have added these import statements, the code should be able to run without any issues.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the pygame module and the sys module. These modules are required for the game to run properly. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import sys
```

Once you have added these import statements, the code should be able to run without any issues."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code looks good overall, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the Snake class, the move() method is responsible for updating the position of the snake's segments. However, there is no check to prevent the snake from reversing its direction and colliding with itself immediately.

To fix this, you can add a check in the move() method to ensure that the snake cannot reverse its direction and collide with itself. Here's the revised code for the move() method:

```python
def move(self):
    x, y = self.segments[0]
    if self.direction == 'up':
        y -= 10
    elif self.direction == 'down':
        y += 10
    elif self.direction == 'left':
        x -= 10
    elif self.direction == 'right':
        x += 10
    new_head = (x, y)
    if new_head in self.segments[1:]:
        # Snake collided with itself, game over
        return False
    self.segments.insert(0, new_head)
    if len(self.segments) > self.size:
        self.segments.pop()
    return True
```

With this change, the move() method will return False if the snake collides with itself, indicating that the game should end.

Please make this modification to ensure that the snake cannot collide with itself immediately after reversing its direction.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the Snake class, the move() method is responsible for updating the position of the snake's segments. However, there is no check to prevent the snake from reversing its direction and colliding with itself immediately.

To fix this, you can add a check in the move() method to ensure that the snake cannot reverse its direction and collide with itself. Here's the revised code for the move() method:

```python
def move(self):
    x, y = self.segments[0]
    if self.direction == 'up':
        y -= 10
    elif self.direction == 'down':
        y += 10
    elif self.direction == 'left':
        x -= 10
    elif self.direction == 'right':
        x += 10
    new_head = (x, y)
    if new_head in self.segments[1:]:
        # Snake collided with itself, game over
        return False
    self.segments.insert(0, new_head)
    if len(self.segments) > self.size:
        self.segments.pop()
    return True
```

With this change, the move() method will return False if the snake collides with itself, indicating that the game should end.

Please make this modification to ensure that the snake cannot collide with itself immediately after reversing its direction."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# Snake Game User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake and try to eat apples to grow longer. However, be careful not to hit the window borders or collide with yourself, as that will end the game. The game also keeps track of the number of apples you have eaten.

## Installation

To play the Snake Game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can follow these steps to run the game:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the game files.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game by executing the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Game Controls

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement:

- Up arrow: Move the snake up
- Down arrow: Move the snake down
- Left arrow: Move the snake left
- Right arrow: Move the snake right

## Game Rules

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple, it will grow longer. However, if the snake hits the window borders or collides with itself, the game will end.

## Scoring

The game keeps track of the number of apples you have eaten. The score will be displayed on the screen when the game ends.

## Game Over

 # Snake Game User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake and try to eat apples to grow longer. However, be careful not to hit the window borders or collide with yourself, as that will end the game. The game also keeps track of the number of apples you have eaten.
