# Snake Game with Start Menu

To complete the task of creating a Snake game with a start menu, we have developed the necessary code in Python using the Pygame library. The code consists of three files: `main.py`, `snake.py`, and `menu.py`. 

## Installation

To run the Snake game, you need to install the Pygame library. You can install it using pip or conda. 

```shell
pip install pygame
```

or

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge pygame
```

## Usage

To start the Snake game, run the `main.py` file using Python.

```shell
python main.py
```

The game will open in a new window. You can use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat the food to grow. The game will end if the snake hits the boundaries or itself. 

## Start Menu

The Snake game now includes a start menu. When you run the game, you will see two options: "Play" and "Quit". Use the arrow keys to navigate between the options and press Enter to select an option. 

- If you select "Play", the game will start, and you can play the Snake game as described above.

- If you select "Quit", the game will exit.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three files:

- `main.py`: This is the main file for the Snake game. It contains the game loop and handles the game logic.

- `snake.py`: This file contains the Snake class and related functions. It handles the movement, collision detection, and drawing of the snake.

- `menu.py`: This file contains the Menu class and related functions. It handles the start menu and user input.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code in the `main.py`, `snake.py`, and `menu.py` files. For example, you can change the window size, snake speed, colors, or add additional options to the start menu.

## Conclusion

With the provided code, you can now play the Snake game with a start menu. Have fun playing and feel free to customize the game to your liking! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let us know.
