# Snake Game User Manual

## Introduction
Welcome to the Snake Game! This game is developed using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat apples to increase its length. However, be careful not to hit the boundaries of the window or collide with the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.

## Installation
To play the Snake Game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Pygame: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Pygame:
```
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play
1. Run the Game: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the game code, and run the following command:

2. Main Menu: The game will start with a main menu that allows you to choose between the options "Play" or "Quit". Use the arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select an option.

3. Gameplay: Once you select "Play", the game will start. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys: up, down, left, and right. The snake will move continuously in the direction you choose.
