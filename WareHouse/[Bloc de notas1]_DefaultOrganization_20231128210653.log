According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "[Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt]".

Modality: "text editor".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

main.py

```python

'''

This is the main file of the text editor program.

'''

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog

class TextEditor:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.text_area = tk.Text(root)
        self.text_area.pack()
        
    def save_file(self):
        file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
        if file_path:
            with open(file_path, "w") as file:
                file.write(self.text_area.get("1.0", tk.END))
    
    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    editor = TextEditor(root)
    root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", editor.save_file)
    editor.run()

```

In the above code, we have the main file `main.py` which is responsible for creating the text editor GUI using the tkinter library. It defines a class `TextEditor` with an `__init__` method that initializes the root window and a text area widget. The `save_file` method is used to save the contents of the text area to a file with a .txt extension. The `run` method starts the main event loop of the GUI. Finally, in the `__main__` block, we create an instance of the `TextEditor` class and run the GUI.

This file serves as the entry point for the text editor program.

Now, let's create another file for testing the main file.

test_main.py

```python

'''

This file contains unit tests for the main file.

'''

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
import tkinter as tk
from main import TextEditor

class TestTextEditor(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.editor = TextEditor(self.root)
        
    def tearDown(self):
        self.root.destroy()
        
    def test_save_file(self):
        with patch("tkinter.filedialog.asksaveasfilename", return_value="test.txt"):
            self.editor.text_area.insert(tk.END, "Hello, World!")
            self.editor.save_file()
            
        with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
            
        self.assertEqual(content, "Hello, World!")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()

```

In the above code, we have a test file `test_main.py` that contains unit tests for the main file. It imports the necessary modules and classes and defines a test case class `TestTextEditor` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. The `setUp` method creates an instance of the `TextEditor` class and the `tearDown` method destroys the root window after each test. The `test_save_file` method tests the `save_file` method by mocking the `asksaveasfilename` function and asserting that the file is saved correctly. Finally, in the `__main__` block, we run the unit tests using `unittest.main()`.

These two files together form the core of the text editor program. The `main.py` file provides the GUI and functionality for saving files, while the `test_main.py` file ensures that the main file works as expected.

This is the main file of the text editor program.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `save_file()` method in the `TextEditor` class. This method is responsible for saving the content of the text area to a file with a .txt extension. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `save_file()` method in the `TextEditor` class.

Here's an example of how you can implement the `save_file()` method:

```python
def save_file(self):
    file_path = tk.filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt")
    if file_path:
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(self.text_area.get("1.0", tk.END))
```

This implementation prompts the user to choose a file path to save the text content. It then opens the file in write mode and writes the content of the text area to the file.

Once you've added the `save_file()` method, the code should be able to save the text content to a file with a .txt extension.

Please make the necessary changes and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below: 
Task: "[Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt]".
Modality: "text editor".
Programming Language: " Python"

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the `save_file()` method in the `TextEditor` class. This method is responsible for saving the content of the text area to a file with a .txt extension. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `save_file()` method in the `TextEditor` class.

Here's an example of how you can implement the `save_file()` method:

```python
def save_file(self):
    file_path = tk.filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt")
    if file_path:
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(self.text_area.get("1.0", tk.END))
```

This implementation prompts the user to choose a file path to save the text content. It then opens the file in write mode and writes the content of the text area to the file.

Once you've added the `save_file()` method, the code should be able to save the text content to a file with a .txt extension.

Please make the necessary changes and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
