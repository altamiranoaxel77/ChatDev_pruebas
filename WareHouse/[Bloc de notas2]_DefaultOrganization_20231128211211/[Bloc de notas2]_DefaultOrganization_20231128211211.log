According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "[Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt]".

Modality: "document".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

In this implementation, we have a `TextEditor` class that represents the main application. It creates a tkinter window and a text area where the user can enter and edit text. The `create_menu` method creates a menu bar with options for new, open, save, save as, and exit. The `new_file` method clears the text area. The `open_file` method opens a file dialog and loads the selected file into the text area. The `save_file` method saves the content of the text area to a file. The `save_file_as` method opens a file dialog and saves the content of the text area to the selected file.

To run the application, execute the `main.py` file. The user can then interact with the text editor, create new files, open existing files, and save files with the `.txt` extension.

Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. Currently, when the user selects a file to save, the file dialog allows them to choose any file type, not just `.txt` files. To fix this, we need to modify the `asksaveasfilename` method to include the `defaultextension` parameter with the value `.txt` in the `save_file_as` method. This will ensure that the user can only save files with the `.txt` extension.

To fix the bug, replace the `save_file_as` method with the following code:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

[2023-28-11 21:15:19 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 <COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. Currently, when the user selects a file to save, the file dialog allows them to choose any file type, not just `.txt` files. To fix this, we need to modify the `asksaveasfilename` method to include the `defaultextension` parameter with the value `.txt` in the `save_file_as` method. This will ensure that the user can only save files with the `.txt` extension.

To fix the bug, replace the `save_file_as` method with the following code:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

This modification will restrict the file dialog to only allow the user to save files with the `.txt` extension.

As per the comment, I have modified the `save_file_as` method to include the `defaultextension` parameter with the value `.txt`. This ensures that the user can only save files with the `.txt` extension. The modified code restricts the file dialog to only allow the user to save files with the `.txt` extension.

Please note that the code provided above is the complete and modified version of the original code, with the bug fixed in the `save_file_as` method.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. Currently, it allows the user to save the file without providing a file name or extension. To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the file path is not empty before saving the file.

To fix the bug, modify the `save_file_as` method as follows:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        if file_path.endswith(".txt"):
            with open(file_path, "w") as file:
                file.write(content)
        else:
            with open(file_path + ".txt", "w") as file:
                file.write(content)
```

This updated code checks if the file path ends with ".txt". If it does, it saves the file as is. If not, it appends ".txt" to the file path before saving the file. This ensures that the file is always saved with the correct extension.

Once you make this change, the text editor will properly save files with the ".txt" extension.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. Currently, it allows the user to save the file without providing a file name or extension. To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the file path is not empty before saving the file.

To fix the bug, modify the `save_file_as` method as follows:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:

            with open(file_path + ".txt", "w") as file:
                file.write(content)
```

This updated code checks if the file path ends with ".txt". If it does, it saves the file as is. If not, it appends ".txt" to the file path before saving the file. This ensures that the file is always saved with the correct extension.

Once you make this change, the text editor will properly save files with the ".txt" extension."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. If the user enters a file name without the ".txt" extension, the file will still be saved without the extension. To fix this, we need to check if the file path ends with ".txt" before saving the file. If it doesn't, we should append the extension before saving.

Here's the revised code for the `save_file_as` method:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        if not file_path.endswith(".txt"):
            file_path += ".txt"
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

This ensures that the file is always saved with the ".txt" extension.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. If the user enters a file name without the ".txt" extension, the file will still be saved without the extension. To fix this, we need to check if the file path ends with ".txt" before saving the file. If it doesn't, we should append the extension before saving.

Here's the revised code for the `save_file_as` method:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        if not file_path.endswith(".txt"):
            file_path += ".txt"
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

This ensures that the file is always saved with the ".txt" extension."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. When saving a file with a specified file path, the code checks if the file path ends with ".txt" and appends it if necessary. However, if the user manually enters a file path with an incorrect extension, such as ".docx", the code will still append ".txt" to the file path, resulting in a file with the incorrect extension. To fix this, we should validate the file extension before saving the file.

To validate the file extension, we can use the `os.path.splitext` function to split the file path into the base name and extension. Then, we can check if the extension is ".txt" and proceed with saving the file. If the extension is incorrect, we can display an error message to the user and prompt them to enter a valid file path.

Here's the revised code for the `save_file_as` method:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        if extension != ".txt":
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid File Extension", "Please enter a file path with the '.txt' extension.")
            return
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

Please make the necessary changes to the `save_file_as.py` file and ensure that the `os` module is imported in the `main.py` file. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential bug in the `save_file_as` method. When saving a file with a specified file path, the code checks if the file path ends with ".txt" and appends it if necessary. However, if the user manually enters a file path with an incorrect extension, such as ".docx", the code will still append ".txt" to the file path, resulting in a file with the incorrect extension. To fix this, we should validate the file extension before saving the file.

To validate the file extension, we can use the `os.path.splitext` function to split the file path into the base name and extension. Then, we can check if the extension is ".txt" and proceed with saving the file. If the extension is incorrect, we can display an error message to the user and prompt them to enter a valid file path.

Here's the revised code for the `save_file_as` method:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        if extension != ".txt":
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid File Extension", "Please enter a file path with the '.txt' extension.")
            return
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

Please make the necessary changes to the `save_file_as.py` file and ensure that the `os` module is imported in the `main.py` file. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, if the user manually enters a file path with an incorrect extension, such as ".docx", the code will still append ".txt" to the file path, resulting in a file with the incorrect extension. To fix this, we should validate the file extension before saving the file.\n\nTo validate the file extension, we can use the os.path.splitext function to split the file path into the base name and extension. Then, we can check if the extension is ".txt" and proceed with saving the file. If the extension is incorrect, we can display an error message to the user and prompt them to enter a valid file path.\n\nHere\'s the revised code for the save_file_as method:\n\npython\ndef save_file_as(self):\n    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])\n    if file_path:\n        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)\n        if extension != ".txt":\n            messagebox.showerror("Invalid File Extension", "Please enter a file path with the \'.txt\' extension.")\n            return\n        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)\n        with open(file_path, "w") as file:\n            file.write(content)\n\n\nPlease make the necessary changes to the save_file_as.py file and ensure that the os module is imported in the main.py file.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `save_file_as` method in both `main.py` and `save_file_as.py`, after checking if the file extension is ".txt", it would be helpful to automatically append the extension to the file path if the user forgets to include it. This will ensure that the saved file always has the correct extension.

To implement this improvement, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        if extension != ".txt":
            file_path += ".txt"  # Append the extension if missing
            messagebox.showinfo("File Extension Added", "The file will be saved with the '.txt' extension.")
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(content)
```

This modification will automatically add the ".txt" extension to the file path if it is missing, and display a message to inform the user about the added extension.

Please make this change in both `main.py` and `save_file_as.py` files.

<Instruction>
To implement the suggested improvement, please make the following changes in both `main.py` and `save_file_as.py` files:

1. In the `save_file_as` method, add the following code after the check for the file extension:

```python
file_path += ".txt"  # Append the extension if missing
messagebox.showinfo("File Extension Added", "The file will be saved with the '.txt' extension.")
```

2. Save the modified files.

Please make these changes and ensure that the updated code is functioning as expected.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
The provided codes seem to be correct and fulfill the requirements of the task. The main.py file contains the main application logic for a text editor. It creates a GUI using the tkinter library and provides functionality for creating new files, opening existing files, saving files, and saving files with a specific file path and ".txt" extension.

The save_file_as.py file contains a separate function for saving files with a specified file path and ensuring it has the ".txt" extension. This function can be used in the main.py file to handle the "Save As" functionality.

Overall, the codes look well-structured and follow good coding practices. They should work as expected to create a text editor that allows saving files with the ".txt" extension.

This function can be used in the main.py file to handle the "Save As" functionality.\n\nOverall, the codes look well-structured and follow good coding practices.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `save_file_as` method of the `TextEditor` class, after checking if the file extension is ".txt", the code directly saves the file without confirming with the user. It would be better to display a confirmation message box to ensure that the user wants to save the file with the specified extension.

To implement this improvement, you can modify the `save_file_as` method as follows:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        if extension != ".txt":
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid File Extension", "Please enter a file path with the '.txt' extension.")
            return
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        confirmation = messagebox.askyesno("Confirmation", "Are you sure you want to save the file?")
        if confirmation:
            with open(file_path, "w") as file:
                file.write(content)
```

This modification adds a confirmation message box using `messagebox.askyesno` before saving the file. If the user clicks "Yes", the file will be saved; otherwise, nothing will happen.

Please make this modification to improve the user experience.

This function can be used in the main.py file to handle the "Save As" functionality.\n\nOverall, the codes look well-structured and follow good coding practices.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is well-structured and follows the given regulations. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `save_file_as` method of the `TextEditor` class, after checking if the file extension is ".txt", the code directly saves the file without confirming with the user. It would be better to display a confirmation message box to ensure that the user wants to save the file with the specified extension.

To implement this improvement, you can modify the `save_file_as` method as follows:

```python
def save_file_as(self):
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text Files", "*.txt")])
    if file_path:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        if extension != ".txt":
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid File Extension", "Please enter a file path with the '.txt' extension.")
            return
        content = self.text_area.get(1.0, tk.END)
        confirmation = messagebox.askyesno("Confirmation", "Are you sure you want to save the file?")
        if confirmation:
            with open(file_path, "w") as file:
                file.write(content)
```

This modification adds a confirmation message box using `messagebox.askyesno` before saving the file. If the user clicks "Yes", the file will be saved; otherwise, nothing will happen.

Please make this modification to improve the user experience."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: [Bloc de notas que permita guardar los textos con extension .txt].
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:

requirements.txt:

```
tkinter==8.6
```

In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the `tkinter` package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the text editor application. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on the version of `tkinter` you have installed or prefer to use.

Note: If you have any additional dependencies or packages required for your specific implementation or if you plan to use any external libraries, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file following the same format, with each package on a new line.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:
requirements.txt:
```
tkinter==8.6
```
In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the `tkinter` package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the text editor application. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on the version of `tkinter` you have installed or prefer to use.
Note: If you have any additional dependencies or packages required for your specific implementation or if you plan to use any external libraries, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file following the same format, with each package on a new line. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database
